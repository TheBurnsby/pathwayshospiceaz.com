        <h2>Ethics in healthcare, the principles</h2>
        <h3>Autonomy</h3>
        <p>Requires that the patient have <strong>autonomy of thought</strong>. Society recognizes the importance of the will of the patient to make an informed decision. Autonomy means freedom to make a choice free from influence. In many cases autonomy is lost in the emotions of the healthcare system. All parties involved in the process of dealing healthcare should respect the will of the patient and their freedoms in making an informed choice. The healthcare team should make education available to the patient and help assist the patient in making an informed decision without violating any potential conflicts of interest. Healthcare should be about what is important to the patient, not the medical professionals.</p>

        <h3>Beneficence</h3>
        <p>An action that is done in the benefit of the patient. The medical team should take actions that will serve the interests of the patient.</p>

        <h3>Justice</h3>
        <p>Requires that procedures uphold the spirit of existing laws and are fair to all players involved.  The health care provider must consider four main areas when evaluating justice: fair distribution of scarce resources, competing needs, rights and obligations, and potential <strong>conflicts with established legislation</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Non-maleficence</h3>
        <p>"First, do no harm" - Requires that a procedure does not harm the patient involved or others in society above attempts in doing "good". Providers of healthcare should not perform procedures that they feel are "good" without evaluating the procedure properly.</p>
